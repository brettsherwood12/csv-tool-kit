# CSV Tool-Kit

This is a clone of an website that a company I interviewed with uses for data processing, ie. uploading Google adwords data as csv files and altering it for analysis purposes. It's for internal use only, I only briefly saw how it works during the interview, but decided to recreate it to the best of my ability using the tech that was mentioned in the job description - Flask, and dropzone for handling csv uploads.
